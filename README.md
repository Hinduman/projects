The files in the repository are the some of the projects I've worked on, in Data Science category

Following are Jupyter notebooks along with the business cases (I've not uploaded the dataset because of restrictions applied from the owner) -

PRCP-1025.ipynb : This notebook predicts the price of the flight, by training the dataset with different ML models. (This is a Regression problem)

PRCP-1007.ipynb : This notebook is predicting the patients who are having liver disease, through different trained ML models. (This is a Classification problem)
